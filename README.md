# inception

Intermediate level Docker project where we use docker-compose to create 3 containers (one for nginx, one for Wordpress and one for MariaDB) and make them communicate thanks to networks. We also use volumes to make data persistent. A cool project that helps us understand how to create and manage webservers.
